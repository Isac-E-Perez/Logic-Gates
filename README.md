# Logic Gates Project

### About:

For this project, I created a circuit and used VHDL code to implement the following circuit whose output is 'F'.

### Notes:

The circuit diagram was made in Simulink and the following simulation is provided in the files.

### Results:

In VHDL, A, B, and C are the inputs (*IN*), F is an output (*OUT*), and x and y are internal signals (*signal*) of my project.

**I/O's are specified here**
